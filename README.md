Happy Class Emotion Recognition
This project aims to recognize emotions based on facial expressions using Python. The application uses machine learning (or deep learning) techniques to detect emotions from facial images.
Features
Emotion Recognition Model: Classifies various emotion categories (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, etc.).
Real-Time Recognition: Analyzes video streams or webcam feed to detect emotions in real-time.
Easy Integration: Modular components that can be integrated into existing projects or different platforms.
Extensibility: Easily retrain or update the model with new datasets or additional features.

Installation
Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following software and libraries:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
OpenCV
[TensorFlow or PyTorch](https://www.tensorflow.org/ or https://pytorch.org/) (depending on the model used in the project)
Scikit-learn (optional)
Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
Note: If the project includes a requirements.txt file, you can install all dependencies at once with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

git clone https://github.com/BatuhanAyyildizz/Happy_Class_emotion_recognition.git
cd Happy_Class_emotion_recognition


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # MacOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install numpy opencv-python tensorflow

python train.py

python app.py

Usage
Real-Time Emotion Analysis: When the application is running, it uses your camera to analyze facial expressions and displays the detected emotion category on the screen.
Image/Video Analysis: You can run emotion detection on a specific image or video file. For example:

python app.py --image_path ./test_images/example.jpg

python app.py --video_path ./test_videos/example.mp4

Saving Results: The results can be saved in various formats, such as text files, CSVs, or databases, depending on how it is implemented in the code.
